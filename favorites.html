        <p class="content">
          Normally, earth-bound astronomers view Saturn's spectacular ring
          system fully illuminated by reflected sunlight. However, this
          intriguing picture was made to take advantage of an unusual
          orientation, with the Sun actually illuminating the rings from below.
          The three bright ring features are visible because the rings
          themselves are not solid. Composed of many separate chunks of rocky,
          icy material, the rings allow the scattered sunlight to pass through
          them -- offering a dramatic demonstration that they are not
          continuous, uninterrupted bands of material. The picture is a
          false-color composite based on Hubble Space Telescope images recorded
          in November of 1995.
